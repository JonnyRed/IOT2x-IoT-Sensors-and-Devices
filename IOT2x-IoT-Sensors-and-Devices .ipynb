    "\n",
    "![Bipolar Junction Transistor](BJT1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In BJTs, a small current in the base controls the amount of current that flows from the collector to the emitter (in NPN devices), or from the emitter to the collector (in PNP devices). Because of this property, it is common to use BJTs as current amplifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Effect Transistor (FET)\n",
    "Like BJTs, Field Effect Transistors are 3-terminal devices whose conductivity can be controlled with an external source. However, while BJTs are controlled with a small current, FETs are controlled with a small voltage. The three terminals are called: Gate, Source and Drain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical structure of a FET is quite different to the sandwich structure of BJTs. In FETs, the gate terminal is diffused into a substrate to form a channel (see figure below). Gate and substrate are of opposite charge: if the substrate is an N-type semiconductor, the gate is P-type, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Field Effect Transistor](FET.jpg 'Field Effect Transistor')\n",
    "\n",
    "Field Effect Transistors are very important because most of today’s electronic devices use them as their main building block. The reason is the exceedingly small amount of energy necessary to control their conductivity. When FETs are in saturation or cut-off state, they consume practically no power because no current flows through them. Power consumption only occurs during transitions between the saturation and cut-off states.\n",

    "This circuit depicts a transistor configured as a switch that operates a relay. The input – Vin, is a square wave and is allowed to activate the base of the transistor via a switch. When Vin is high, the transistor conducts. The relay is connected to the supply rail and the collector of the transistor, thus when the transistor conducts current flows through the relay, activating it. Note that the output is an inverted version of the input. This closes the load switch (part of the relay) allowing current to flow in the load circuit. The emitter is connected to ground and a voltage divider network is connected between Vin and ground.\n",

    "The circuit illustrates a FET being used as a switch. A lamp is connected to the Drain and supply rail. The input – Vin, is a square wave and is allowed to activate the gate of the FET. When Vin is high, the FET conducts allowing current to flow through the lamp (on). The source is connected to ground. A voltage divider is connected to Vin and ground.

On saturation, the lamp will have a path to ground (0 Volts) and will produce light. On cut-off, the lamp will be effectively disconnected from ground and it will be turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two diagrams there is a flywheel diode connected in parallel with the load. Since a relay and an incandescent lamp are types of inductors, they will store energy as a magnetic field. Flywheel diodes offer a path to the current induced by the stored energy when the relay and lamp are turned off. Without this path, the spurious current would produce a spike of voltage that could damage other components."

    "To deal with analogue variables like temperature or pressure, all we need are devices that ‘translate’ between the analogue, infinite-valued world, and the binary, digital world of computers. These devices are called Analogue to Digital (ADC) and Digital to Analogue (DAC) Converters.\n",

    "### Nyquist Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Nyquist theorem states that in order to be able to reproduce an analogue signal, the sampling rate needs to be at least two times faster than the signal’s highest frequency component. Voltage samples are compared against a reference voltage in the ADC (all ADCs need a reference voltage). The input voltage sample is then given a binary value in the range determined by the number of bits in the converter. The following formula provides the digital output (Out) for any given input voltage (Vin) in our 4-bit ADC example.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Out = \\left ( \\frac{2^4} { V_{ref}} \\right) \\times V_{in}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following graph shows the lineal relationship between the input voltage and the digital output. Note that for the digital number to accurately represent the temperature in the room, the relation between temperature and resistance must be a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Nyquist](Nyquist.jpg 'Nyquist theorem')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "n our example we used 4 bits for simplicity, however real ADCs use 10 to 20 bits; hence the steps between digital values represent very small variations in the analogue input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once analogue values are converted to digital numbers, computers can then process them and make decisions based on the results. That will be the subject of a future module.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert digital numbers back to analogue signals we use a DAC. The following figure shows the generic connection of a DAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Nyquist](Nyquist.jpg 'Nyquist theorem')\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_{Out} = \\left ( \\frac{V_{ref}}{2^4} \\right ) \\times In$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $V_{out}$ can only take 16 possible values; hence this output is no longer analogue in the strict sense. The error induced by the rounding-off that takes place during the digital to analogue conversion is known as quantization error. To minimise quantization errors we can either increase the number of bits of the converter, or increase the sampling frequency, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values in the output of a DAC are updated at a fixed rate similar to the sampling rate used in ADCs. A whole field called Digital Signal Processing  studies algorithms that can be applied to digitised signals."

    "As we have seen, a sensor converts the physical environment (for example:  temperature, blood pressure, humidity, etc.) into a digital value or an analogue signal. There are a vast array of sensors available to utilise in our IoT projects. So many, in fact, that it’s hard to know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t really matter what we are sensing, as the approach and implementation of interfacing is similar. Sure, some attributes like sampling rate, processing requirements and signal levels change, but we can generally classify them according to their properties.\n",

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Sensitivity__\n",
    "The sensitivity of the sensor is defined as the slope of the output characteristic curve  or, more generally, the minimum input of physical parameter that will create a detectable output change. \n",
    "    * Sensitivity Error -\n",
    "The sensitivity error is a departure from the ideal slope of the characteristic curve. For example, the pressure transducer discussed above may have an actual sensitivity of 7.8 mV/V/mm Hg instead of 10 mV/V/mm Hg.\n",
    "* __Range__\n",
    "The range of the sensor is the maximum and minimum values of applied parameter that can be measured. For example, a given pressure sensor may have a range of -400 to +400 mm Hg.\n",
    "    * Dynamic Range\n",
    "The dynamic range is the total range of the sensor from minimum to maximum. \n",
    "* __Precision__\n",
    "The concept of precision refers to the degree of reproducibility of a measurement. In other words, if exactly the same value were measured a number of times, an ideal sensor would output exactly the same value every time. But real sensors output a range of values distributed in some manner relative to the actual correct value. For example, suppose a pressure of exactly 150 mm Hg is applied to a sensor. Even if the applied pressure never changes, the output values from the sensor will vary considerably. Some subtle problems arise in the matter of precision when the true value and the sensor's mean value are not within a certain distance of each other\n",
    "(e.g., the 1-s range of the normal distribution curve).\n",
    "* __Resolution__\n",
    "This specification is the smallest detectable incremental change of input parameter that can be detected in the output signal. Resolution can be expressed either as a proportion of the reading (or the full-scale reading) or in absolute terms.\n",
    "* __Accuracy__\n",
    "The accuracy of the sensor is the maximum difference that will exist between the actual value (which must be measured by a primary or good secondary standard) and the indicated value at the output of the sensor. Again, the accuracy can be expressed either as a percentage of full scale or in absolute terms.\n",
    "* __ Offset__\n",
    "The offset error of a transducer is defined as the output that will exist when it should be zero or, alternatively, the difference between the actual output value and the specified output value under some particular set of conditions.\n",
    "* __Linearity__\n",
    "The linearity of the transducer is an expression of the extent to which the actual measured curve of a sensor departs from the ideal curve. Figure 3 shows a somewhat exaggerated relationship between the ideal, or least squares fit, line and the actual measured or calibration line (Note in most cases, the static curve is used to determine linearity, and this may deviate somewhat from a dynamic linearity) Linearity is often specified in terms of percentage of nonlinearity, which is defined as:\n",
    "$$Nonlinearity(\\%) = \\frac{D_{in(max)}}{IN_{f.x}} \\times 100$$\n",

    "* $D_{in(max)} $ the maximum input deviation\n",
    "* $IN_{f.x}$ is the maximum, full-scale input\n",
    "* __Hysteresis__\n",
    "A transducer should be capable of following the changes of the input parameter regardless of which direction the change is made; hysteresis is the measure of this property.\n",
    "* __Response Time__\n",
    "Sensors do not change output state immediately when an input parameter change occurs. Rather, it will change to the new state over a period of time, called the response time. The response time can be defined as the time required for a sensor output to change from its previous state to a final settled value within a tolerance band of the correct new value.\n",
    "* __Dynamic Linearity__\n",
    "The dynamic linearity of the sensor is a measure of its ability to follow rapid changes in the input parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Environmental condition__: Usually has limits for temperature/humidity. These environmental factors can even have an effect on the readings and need to be factored into the calculations. E.g. accelerometers are sensitive to temperature and often have a temperature sensor incorporated into the device.\n",
    "1. __Calibration__: Essential for most of the measuring devices, as the readings change with time.\n",
    "1. Sensors can be classified based on __power__ or __energy supply requirement__:\n",

    " ### Water salinity\n",
    " \n",
    " The level of dissolved salt in water is a critical measurement in many industries, particularly agriculture. However there isn’t a sensor available (at a reasonable cost, easy portability, etc.) that will directly measure NaCl (the type of salt we are interested in). So, the common approach is to approximate this value by measuring something that is a by-product of salinity levels: in this case, conductivity. As salinity increases, the impedance (resistance) decreases, as you can see in the table below:\n",

    "In this project, Shiva measures the acceleration and angular velocity of the foot and shin, in patients with a condition known as ‘foot drop’.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the foot acceleration and angular velocity is 0, and the shin IMU registers only gravity, we can infer that the foot is flat on the ground and the knee is straight. This gives us a reference point for all other measurements in the system, and allows for the calculation of the minimum and maximum deflection of the ankle joint… even though at no point did we directly measure an angle, or look to see if the patient’s foot is flat on the ground!\n",

Sometimes many devices can share the same set of wires. This connection mode is usually referred to as a bus. In other networks, one master can connect to more than one slave using dedicated wires.

In most transactions, the master initiates the exchange of information and determines when it finishes. To use the communication channel, slaves have to wait until the master grants them access, otherwise more than one slave could be transmitting information at the same, causing a collision.\n",

    "Most IoT systems utilise microcontroller units (MCUs) to collect data and transfer it to the processing units through the Internet. The advantages of using MCUs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are relatively simple, as MCUs do not require an operating system to function and are easy to interface with external components such as sensors.\n",
    "* A MCU is usually sufficient to provide processing power and functionality in most IoT systems, thus making them economically viable for IoT applications.\n",
    "* Due to their simplicity, MCUs are less vulnerable to security attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A microprocessor is a micro version of our computers, hence the name ‘microprocessor’.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that generally, if an application requires a form of Operating System, a microprocessor is normally used. A good example is our smartphones, which often use ARM microprocessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microcontrollers vs microprocessors \n",
    "\n",
    "Microprocessors can be thought of as more advanced embedded systems than microcontrollers.  The main differences between a microprocessor and a microcontroller are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A microcontroller is 'all in one': the processor, RAM, and IO are all on the one chip - as such, you cannot (for instance) increase the amount of RAM available or the number of IO ports. The controlling bus is internal and not available to the board designer.\n",
    "* A microprocessor generally does not have on-chip RAM, ROM, and few GPIO pins. It usually uses its pins as a bus to interface with RAM, ROM, serial ports, digital and analogue IO, etc. As such, it is expandable at the board level.\n",

    "\n",
    "*  Unlike PCs and mobile devices, there's a wide variety of commercial and open source operating systems powering the IoT. Here are eight leading contenders and the best use-cases for them.\n",
    "    1. __RIOT OS__  \n",
    "    RIOT OS is an open source community project that has been ongoing since 2008. RIOT is capable of running on a [variety of platforms](http://www.riot-os.org/#usage)\n",
    " including embedded devices and PCs (and a large number of the most popular sensor/actuator boards), and has an easy-to-use API. The OS is well known for its ability to be efficient in terms of power usage and resource requirements.\n",
    "    1. ¨__Windows 10 For IoT Microsoft's  __\n",
    "     Latest embedded OS is known as [Windows 10 for IoT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/windows-iot)  Under this umbrella, there are three subset operating systems available, depending on your needs. First is Windows 10 for IoT Mobile, which supports the ARM architecture. Next is Windows 10 for IoT Core, which supports Raspberry Pi and Intel Atom. Last, you have Windows 10 for IoT Enterprise -- more or less full-blown Windows 10 Enterprise, but restricted to running a single application.  \n",
    "     Because Windows 10 for IoT is so new, it obviously lags behind many others in terms of user base and experienced developers. That said, the OS has tremendous potential -- especially if you want to develop apps in-house. Ultimately, those comfortable programming for Windows using Visual Studio and Azure IoT services will gravitate toward the suite of Windows 10 for IoT options.\n",
    "    1. __WindRiver VxWorks__  \n",
    "    Probably the most popular commercial RTOS used today is WindRiver's VxWorks. It provides a robust OS that's highly scalable. VxWorks also provides a great number of security features that are critical for IoT projects that demand them. VxWorks is very well-known in the industrial, medical, and aerospace fields because it is one of the few RTOS vendors that have met the necessary [__certification requirements__](http://windriver.com/products/vxworks/#certified_products) to be used in those industries.\n",
    "    1. __Google Brillo__  \n",
    "    Last fall at the Google I/O conference, Google announced its intention to enter the embedded OS market by introducing [Brillo](https://developers.google.com/brillo/). The developer platform for an Android-based embedded OS is great for those who have extensive backgrounds programming Android apps. Brillo uses a communications protocol called Weave. This means that smart devices don't necessarily have to have embedded Android as their OS -- they only have to have the ability to communicate using Weave. This opens the door to a lot more vendors incorporating Weave in their IoT products -- ultimately making them Brillo-compatible.\n",
    "    1. __ARM Mbed OS__  \n",
    "    ARM is developing its own open source embedded OS called [mbed OS](https://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-os/). Since it's being developed by ARM, that's the only architecture supported. That said, the OS is expected to make a splash in the smart-home and wearable-device IoT segments. The OS differs from many other embedded operating systems because it's single-threaded -- as opposed to multi-threaded. ARM says it feels this is necessary for it to be able to run on the smallest and lowest-power devices out there. If physical size and battery life are critical, the IoT device may end up running on the mbed OS.\n",
    "    1. __Embedded Apple iOS And OS X__  \n",
    "    While Apple has yet to play a significant role in today's IoT market, it certainly is expected to do so very soon. Up to this point, Apple has adopted variants of its iOS platform and created IoT devices such as Apple TV, CarPlay (with the help of BlackBerry QNX), and the Apple Watch.  \n",
    "Moving forward, Apple is expected to continue its use of iOS -- and to modify OS X so that it runs leaner and more efficiently on IoT endpoints. Developers use tools such as the recently released [HomeKit](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/) -- a framework used to create apps to control home automation devices.\n",
    "    1. __Nucleus RTOS__  \n",
    "    Nucleus RTOS is an embedded OS developed by Mentor Graphics. The company claims the software is currently running on more than 3 billion devices -- which is an impressive install base. The OS has robust support for [various embedded architectures](https://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/nucleus/processor-support) and is popular in industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare, utilities, industrial, and consumer electronics.\n",
    "    1. __Green Hills Integrity__  \n",
    "    Yet another longstanding commercial RTOS solution is Green Hills' Integrity. It fiercely competes in the aerospace/defense, automotive, industrial, and medical verticals. The company is also continuing to be popular in the consumer-focused IoT market thanks to its long-standing popularity and reputation for performance, security, and reliability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Unlike with PCs, tablets, and smartphones, there likely won't be a short list of operating systems that dominate the entire IoT market. Instead, we're going to have to deal with dozens of popular choices that have specific pros and cons. This list of eight operating systems shows the wide variety of choices and where they are likely to be used."

    "__Serial communication protocol__ is the common protocol used for microcontrollers’ communications. It involves the process of transmitting a series of digital pulses between sender and receiver on specified data rate, and is generally divided into __synchronous__ and __asynchronous__ categories.\n",

    "### Asynchronous serial communication\n",
    "\n",
    "In asynchronous serial communication, transmitter and receiver manually agree on the data rate, and each manage the timing independently with no common clock. That means the data rate for the transmitter sending pulses __is the same__ as data rate for the receiver listening for the pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmitter and receiver are required to __agree on some parameters__ to establish the asynchronous communication, including;\n",

    "Generally, in most microcontrollers the high voltage is either +5V or +3.3V representing the 1 bit, and low voltage is 0V representing 0 bit. At the end of the data transmission, the receiver end is able to rebuild the original message by using the interpreted bits from voltage level.\n",

    "For example, a device to monitor water quality may sense temperature, salinity, turbidity and oxygen levels, but performs no action locally. The data is transmitted back to a data centre where it is analysed, and some action may be taken (e.g. turn on a fountain for oxygenation). But even in this case, we can see there is an overall feedback path, but it is distributed.\n",

One advantage is the fact that the use of feedback makes the system response relatively insensitive to external disturbances, and internal variations in system parameters, such as temperature. It is thus possible to use relatively inaccurate and inexpensive components to obtain the accurate control of a given process or plant.\n",

    "\n",
    "PID systems are found in a wide range of applications for \n",
    "* industrial process control, \n",
    "* sensor devices, and even \n",
    "* robotics. \n",
    "    \n",
    "PID refers to the type of feedback path that this type of controller uses - in fact it uses three different paths, which is why a PID is also called a ‘three term controller’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous examples were basically linear feedback systems, where the level of signal fed back to the input was directly proportional to the output of the system. This is, in fact, the first or \n",
    "* P part of the PID controller, proportional. \n",
    "* The I is integral, and \n",
    "* the D is derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three modes are used in different combinations:\n",
    "* P – Sometimes used\n",
    "* PI - Most often used\n",
    "* PID – Sometimes used\n",
    "* PD – rare, but can be useful for controlling servomotors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![proportional-integral-derivative controller](PID.jpg \"proportional-integral-derivative controller\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this algorithm revolves around manipulating the error. The error (used for feedback) is the difference between the:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Process Variable__ (__PV__ - what we are trying to control, e.g. current temperature in our home);  and the\n",
    "* __Set Point__ (__SP__ - e.g. the temperature we would like our home to be)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, The __PV__ is subtracted from the __SP__ to create the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The error is simply multiplied by one, two, or all of the calculated P, I, and D actions (depending which are implemented);\n",
    "* Then the resulting combination of error values are added together and sent to the controller output;\n",
    "* If the PV and SP are the same, we don’t have to do anything (e.g. the temperature set in our home is the same as the temperature read by the sensors);\n",
    "* However, if there is a disparity between the SP and the PV, we have an error, and corrective action is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In delving further into how PID works, let’s consider the analogy of driving a car, and changing lanes on a freeway on a windy day. The driver is the ‘responsive’ controller in the process, as they are controlling the change in the car’s position.\n",

    "Below is a simplified diagram of a PID controller for this system.\n",
    "![proportional-integral-derivative controller](PID1.jpg \"proportional-integral-derivative controller\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how important closing the feedback loop is. If the feedback loop was removed (as in an open loop control system), it would be like steering the car with our eyes closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous house temperature example, the controller takes the both the PV and SP signals, and puts them through a black box to calculate a controller output. That controller output is then sent to an actuator, which moves to control the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proportional control\n",
    "Let’s isolate the proportional (P) part of our feedback loop in the diagram below.\n",
    "![Proportional control](PID2.jpg \"Proportional control\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In __Proportional only__ mode, the controller simply multiplies the __Error__ by the __Proportional Gain__ (officially termed $K_p$) to get the controller output. The Proportional Gain is the setting that we tune to get our desired performance from a __P only__ controller.\n",

    "Let’s start by using $K_P$ as our bias (ideal conditions and the rate we would like to change at), and add in another form of feedback – __the Integral__! Also known as the ‘automatic reset’, the Integral works simply by __resetting the bias of the gain until it’s zero again__.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Integral control](PID5.jpg \"Integral control\")\n",
    "The combination of __Proportional__ and __Integral__ action seems to do a reasonably good job of controlling our system. In fact, PI controllers are probably the most common configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Derivative action\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type of action in PID control is the Derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The effect of the derivative is to __counteract the overshoot__ caused by P and I\n",
    "* When the error is large, the P and the I will increase the controller output\n",
    "** This controller response makes the error change quickly, which in turn causes the derivative to act more aggressively to counteract the P and the I\n",
    "* $K_D$ uses the rate of change of the error to calculate its ‘damping’ effect on the system.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the Integral action, we need to be careful in choosing a Derivative value, but it is not as critical, as it may just stop us reaching our set point (or the correct place in the lane, in our car scenario).\n",
